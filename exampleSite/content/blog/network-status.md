## Recent Improvements

### Bandwidth Optimization

We've implemented new compression algorithms that reduce bandwidth usage by approximately 40% while maintaining visual fidelity. This is particularly beneficial for users on limited connections.

### New Relay Nodes

Two new relay nodes have been deployed:

| Node | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Delta | SA-East | Online |
| Epsilon | AF-South | Testing |

### Archive Expansion

The central archive now contains over 10,000 ASCII cinema recordings, including:

- Classic film conversions
- Original network productions
- Live stream recordings
- Interactive experiences

## Upcoming Maintenance

The next scheduled maintenance window will occur on the first Sunday of next month, 0200-0400 UTC. Expect intermittent connectivity during this period.

Stay connected.
