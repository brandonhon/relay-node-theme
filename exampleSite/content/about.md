## About Relay Node

Relay Node is a distributed network for ASCII cinema streaming. Our mission is to preserve and share the art of text-based entertainment across the global network.

### The Network

Our infrastructure spans multiple continents, with relay nodes positioned strategically to minimize latency and maximize uptime. Each node operates independently while maintaining synchronization with the central archive.

### Technology Stack

- **Streaming Protocol**: Custom optimized for low-bandwidth ASCII transmission
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with ANSI color support
- **Clients**: Standard SSH/Telnet compatible

### History

The Relay Node network was established to bring classic ASCII cinema to a new generation of viewers. What started as a single server has grown into a global mesh of interconnected nodes.

### Contact

For node operators and contributors, reach out via the standard encrypted channels.
